  "readme": "Modest Maps JS is a BSD-licensed display and interaction library for tile-based\nmaps in Javascript.\n\nOur intent is to provide a minimal, extensible, customizable, and free display\nlibrary for discriminating designers and developers who want to use interactive\nmaps in their own projects. Modest Maps provides a core set of features in a\ntight, clean package, with plenty of hooks for additional functionality.\n\n# [Documentation](https://github.com/modestmaps/modestmaps-js/wiki)\n\n## Building\n\nThis package includes a copy of [YUICompressor](http://developer.yahoo.com/yui/compressor/),\nwhich requires a version of Java on your system. To create a new build of\nModest Maps (only necessary for development), run `make` from the root\ndirectory.\n\n## Developing with npm:\n\nModest Maps includes a `package.json` file to guide usage of its code on the\nserver-side, and to handle certain dependencies.\n\nTo install developer dependencies - needed for documentation and tests -\nyou'll need [npm](http://npmjs.org/):\n\n    npm install --dev\n\n## Tests\n\nTests require `expresso` to be installed by `npm`, as noted above. To run tests,\n\n    make tests\n",
